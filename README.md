# Bitcoin-Ticker

This website is using to grab a particular data from the bitcoinaverage.com using an **API** .Basically our server is making a request to the bitcoin average server and in the request we packaged some parameters.And when the bitcoin average server recieves the request along with the parameter it will look through its database and send back a response in the form of data. Note: This whole process occurs through API only. In this website we are grabbing a live Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency data and check the latest prices of the cryptocurrency.The website will provide the current price of *crypto* in *fiat* currency . Example: current price of one Bitcoin in USDollars or current price of one Litecoins in GBpounds.
